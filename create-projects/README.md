# Create a Gradle Project

To create a Gradle project run the following command in the same folder as the script:

```bash
./create-gradle-project.sh <project-name>
```

<project-name> will be the folder where all Gradle dependencies and the project folder structure will be created.

Alternatively, you can specify a path to where you want your project to be created, e.g.:

```bash
./create-gradle-project.sh /Documents/workspace/<project-name>
```
