A project to store useful scripts needed during the apprenticeship - and maybe even after that :)

## Quick way to use it without clone the repo
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codurance-apprenticeship/scripts/master/create-projects/create-gradle-project.sh | bash -s [projectname]

```
